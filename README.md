# Navigations & sections

## Overview

- *Continue work on your `dog-rescue-pattern-library`*
- Design all the different navigation patterns that your website needs:
  - Are there next/previous or page buttons?
  - Is there a secondary nav?
  - Bread crumbs?
  - Can the main navigation be designed separately from the masthead?
- Also design all the different section styles for your website—each different grouping of content or images should be styled:
  - Images & pieces of text?
  - Groups of cards?
  - Intro text chunks?
- *Run your pattern library through Markbot and make sure it passes all the checks.*

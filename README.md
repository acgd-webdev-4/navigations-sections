# Navigations & sections

## Overview

- *Continue work on your `ecommerce-pattern-library`*
- Design all the different secondary navigation patterns that your website needs:
  - *Concentrate on secondary navigations*—**we’ll do the main nav next week when we do the header.**
  - Are there next/previous or page buttons?
  - Is there a secondary nav in the sidebar?
  - What about product filters?
  - Bread crumbs?
- Also design all the different section styles for your website—each different grouping of content or images should be styled:
  - Images & pieces of text?
  - Intro text chunks?
  - Banner-like sections?
  - *We don’t need to do groupings of cards—we’re looking for uniquely designed components.*
- *Run your pattern library through Markbot and make sure it passes all the checks.*
